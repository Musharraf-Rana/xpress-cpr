                                <p>Our founder and amazing instructor Lorraine over the span of 30 years as a nurse has
                                    experienced several life threating scenarios. In 2010 during the birthday party of
                                    Lorraineâ€™s 10-year-old son an incident occurred which made her realize CPR education
                                    was
                                    the need of time. A beautiful 6-year-old who was attending the birthday party
                                    drowned in
                                    the pool and had been unconscious for several minutes before Lorraine noticed her
                                    and
                                    pulled her out.
